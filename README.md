## Notes
This repo may not cover all simulations. Please reach out to me if you need any other files. For potential questions, I will do my best to answer (as it has been 10 years since my research).

Background story: After 10 years, I decided to dig out some of the old files that I used for my Master's research. Files may be messy and not well documented. I wrote the programs prior to having any industry experience.
